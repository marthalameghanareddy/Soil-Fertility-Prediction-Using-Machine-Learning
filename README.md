1. Purpose of the Project
     The proposed system aims to predict the soil fertility for better yield production or vegetation cover.To be precise and accurate in predicting fertility, the project analyses the nutrient contents present in the soil.With this, we can reduce the human effort in the industrial sector where they predict the quality of the soil.

2. Software files
     In this project we need NumPy,pandas,sikit-learn,Google Collaboratory and flask.We need to install NumPy,pandas,sikit-learn and flask in your system before starting up with the project.We can use the Google Collaboratory directly through the browser without any installation.

3. Project files
   The project files are:
	  i.Soil_Fertility_Prediction.ipynb
	  ii.proj.py
	  iii.ProjectHomePage.html
	  iv.dataset.txt
	  v.soil_data.xlsx
	  vi.preprocessed_data.csv

5. Project Execution Steps Step 
   Step 1 : Create a folder and place dataset.txt,proj.py files in it.
   Step 2 : Create a folder with name templates in the folder where we placed dataset.txt,proj files.
   Step 3 : Place the ProjectHomePage.html file in templates folder.
   Step 4 : select proj.py file--> Right click on proj.py file --> select open with --> click Python.
   Step 5 : Python terminal will be opened and a url will be displayed.
   Step 6 : Copy and paste that url in your browser and press enter the webpage will be opened.
   Step 7 :  Enter the 14 nutrient values in the webpage and click on predict button.
   Step 8 : The result will be displayed in the webpage.
